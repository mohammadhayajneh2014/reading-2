A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

example:

 p ,h1, h2, h3 {
font-family: Arial;
color: yellow;}
( arial, yellow = Value)
(coler,font-family = ProPerty)

( * {} ) Targets all elements on the page.
( .note {} ) Targets any element whose class attribute has a value of note.
(#introduction {} ) Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction.
